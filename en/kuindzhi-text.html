            <h2>THE ART MANAGER OF THE 19TH CENTURY</h2>
            <p>...Firstly, and this topic is especially relevant even today, and it is truly important: Arkhip Ivanovich Kuindzhi is a Ukrainian artist!</p>
            <p>Secondly, his figure in art should be perceived as one of the brightest geniuses of the landscape genre, as a self-sufficient, self-valuable direction in painting. Each of his works speaks to us with the true spirit of nature, the philosophy of nature.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a talented person, as they say, is talented in everything, so, in our time, A. I. Kuindzhi could also be a successful art manager, promoter, producer… and the history of the painting "Moonlight Night on the Dnieper" confirms this to the highest degree.</p>
            <p>Previously, no one had ever captivated the entire (!) motley society with intrigue: aesthetes, colleagues, officials, gawkers, art connoisseurs.</p>
            
           <h2 class="section-title">THE ENIGMA OF ONE PAINTING</h2> 
           <p class="spotlight-quote">
            Previously, no one had ever organized such an unusual exhibition – a solo-painting exhibition.<br>
            Only this painting.<br>
            The windows were draped.<br>
            The light was directed at it.<br>
            And it – shines!
            </p> 
            
            <p>This unique, enchanting radiance, filled simultaneously with the stunning silence of the Ukrainian night and such "Gogol-esque mystique," became the main mystery for the viewer. 13,000 visitors came to solve this riddle, to recognize the secret of the "Kuindzhi Moonlight"! An incredible number for the 19th century! The crowd was fantastic!<br> 
                People strictly monitored compliance with the queue (well, of course…) and the limited time spent near the canvas. 11. A certain "timing" was established, if we use the features of modern language, fashion, culture… <br>
            And those who finally made it to the painting literally squinted from this shimmering, from this holographic effect. </p>

            
            <h3>Gossip Multiplied:</h3>
            <ul class="gossip-list">
                <li>Skeptics: "It's cheating! The painting is done on glass. There is a lamp behind the canvas!"</li>
                <li>Mystics: "It's sorcery, magic! The painting was created with moonlight paint based on mother-of-pearl."</li>
                <li>Scientists: "It's scientific progress, the result of chemical experiments," (said those who knew about Kuindzhi’s friendship with Mendeleev).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In any case, no one was silent! Here it is – the "power of PR" multiplied by the "power of art"! Today it is certainly known how Kuindzhi did this. There is a whole list of progressive, innovative, experimental techniques and methods. For example, one of the ingredients that the artist added to the paints was bitumen – a component of modern asphalt paving… <br>
            But! No matter how perfect, no art study is capable of answering not how, but why. Why is this a true masterpiece? </p>

                <p><strong>Stanislav Liudkevych is a man-epoch!</strong> not only because he was destined to celebrate his 100th birthday, but also in the sense of his significance in the history of the musical art of Ukraine.</p>
                <p>Among the composer's works, "Old Song" was and remains a special page. 21. Simple and moving, it sings without words about something very native, cozy, understandable, and close to the heart. It sings out tenderness, peace, and warmth in every note.</p>
